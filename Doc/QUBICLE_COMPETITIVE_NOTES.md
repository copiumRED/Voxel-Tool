# QUBICLE_COMPETITIVE_NOTES

## Strengths We Must Match (Workflow/UX)
- Fast blockout-to-export loop with minimal clicks.
- Predictable voxel paint/erase behavior with strong visual feedback.
- Efficient part/object workflow (create, duplicate, organize, isolate).
- Reliable symmetry tools for rapid stylized modeling.
- Stable save/open and dependable export interoperability.
- Shortcut-driven editing speed for experienced users.

## Common Pain Points We Can Beat
- Confusing edit targeting when camera/picking is ambiguous.
- Hidden failure modes (blank viewport, silent render/export issues).
- Weak session resilience (unclear errors, difficult recovery).
- Friction in palette workflow and repetitive color operations.
- Export mismatch surprises between editor and target tools.

## Differentiators We Can Claim (Spec + Current Build Direction)
- Voxel-first pipeline with integrated solidify path (surface + greedy meshing).
- Multi-format export trajectory (OBJ + glTF + VOX) in one lightweight editor.
- Live analysis/stats panel for game-budget-aware iteration.
- Strong diagnostics/logging orientation for reliability and maintainability.
- Planned Phase 2 path toward Blender-like mesh refinement after Phase 1 hardening.
